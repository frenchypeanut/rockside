# Tell me more about Rockside

## Which chains and implementations are supported?

 - Mainnet (geth/parity)
 - Ropsten (geth/parity)
 - Rinkeby (geth/parity)
 - Tobalaba (parity)

_(Pantheon Ethereum client integration in progress !)_

## Why use only Ethereum as a starting point?

Because we believe in the potential of this protocol. Ethereum is popular, public, open-source and robust. Furthermore, it fits to many corporate needs. Other blockchain technologies will be added very soon !

## Is it risky to send transaction to Rockside's nodes during alpha version?

Before sending transaction to **your own** Rockside node(s), you need to create and sign them offline. Rockside have no visibility of your private key. Finally the question is : is Blockchain protocol secure ? Yes, by design ;)

## What is the difference with services offering remote nodes ?

If the remote service is malicious or gets hacked, this trusted third party can censor your transactions, show you fake data, collect data on your IP, â€¦
Rockside is different because you host your own nodes and you keep control over your interactions with Blockchain networks.
