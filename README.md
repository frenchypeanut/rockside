# Rockside Wiki 🎸


## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
Rockside is a self-hosted Blockchain Service Provider. Its goal is to accelerate the industrialization of blockchain projects for companies and developers.


The following documentation is relative the first public beta release of Rockside -EthCC community edition release- which **will be available 5th March 2019**. If you try to run it before this date, there is no guarantee that the commands mentioned in this documentation would work, because useful stuff may have not been released yet.


Rockside is already used as a private beta since November 1, 2018 for Rockside Launch Customer Program members. This program has been launched to request feedback from first Rockside users, and let them participate to the roadmap of the product.

See you on March 5th !
