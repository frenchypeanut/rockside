## Are all RPC methods accessible from my Node?

The open RPC api open on your Node are `eth`, `web3`, `txpool`, `net` on `geth` and `eth`, `web3`, `net`, `parity` on `parity`.

Moreover we block `eth_coinbase`, `eth_accounts`, `eth_sign`, `eth_sendTransaction` due to their reliance on local Node's accounts.

## How to use Rockside Node in your Truffle project ?

A mnemonic is a pattern of letters, words, or associations which allows you to easily remember information. This system gives a human readable format of words to back-up your wallet for recovery. You can generate a mnemonic using [Metamask Seed](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489431-Exporting-Your-Seed-Phrase) or [hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/) or [online mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) generator. **Mnemonic = private keys = your identity = your wallets = your tokens = ðŸ˜±! We highly recommend keep your mnemonic secret. Never pass it on to anyone and keep it as safe as possible.**
